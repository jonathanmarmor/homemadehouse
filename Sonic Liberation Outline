Sonic Liberation Outline

opening blast
    - like gran partita
    - big consonant chord
    - short-long-rest
    - after a few repetitions, oboe fades in later on a high note and sustains longer than the chord
        - maybe ask Kristin, Jessica, and Andrea to identify their most resonant shared pitch
    - then repeat, but flute holds the same note
    - then voice
solo tones
    - repeating oboe-flute-voice (from the previous section) on the same pitch, one long tone at a time with a short gap between.
    - each note a breath length, like in Feb3
    - after a few repetions, another sub-ensemble cues the next section
Feb3
    - the same rules as Feb3 piece
    - get everybody listening, cueing each other, and breathing
Gradual change
    - move from long tones to something more
    - more and more going on
    - melodies emerge
    - shifting harmonies emerge
    - be sure to have a variety of textures: everybody playing, solos, everythng in between
    - decorate the Feb3 structure with a variety show
    - Voice doubles on little keyboard with sustaining recorder sound
    - Piano doubles on little keyboard with plucking/percussive guitar or electric piano sound
    - Give Rachel a chance to improvise solo
    - at some point in here once or twice, all instruments should stop, naturally according to the Feb3 system
    - Some Ideas for little sections:
        - piano plays a sequence of harmonies that all contain the pitches that are being held by other instruments (especially if only one or two pitches are being held)
        - more pitches assigned to each person's event, which the person can use as a scale to noodle around on
        - pitches in each person's event organized as simple repeating phrases
        - gradually move from one pitch, to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    - Target: little duets, trios, quartets, and ensemble pieces that are recognizable fragments of pop and classic rock songs
        - build up to this with smaller, less identifiable fragments
    - Maybe: Use lyrics that are about other songs, like from Paul Simon Rene and Georgette Magritte, Gotta Have a Song, etc
Natural Stop
Mutating Canon
    1. an instrument plays a phrase
    2. another instrument plays the same phrase, offset by ~half the phrase length, transposed and modified in a number of ways to make it consonant with the overlapping phrase
        - when the voice is playing a phrase, it should use the lyrics of a popular song
    3. repeat step 2 again and again and again
Coming in to phase
    - instruments will each start playing the same phrase, offset by about a bar
    - gaps between phrases will be different for each instrument
    - the phrases will gradually come into phase
    - end
